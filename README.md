# Donwload and the set up of the application

1. You can set up your php versions in our local machine as you wish, this project is currently using the version of php 8.1 and symfony 6.4, however if you don't want to deal with the dependencies and composer check the docker in the repository: 
[Docker Repository](https://github.com/nkymf/lleego-docker).

2. if you chosen the way of docker you can go to the install documentation.
2.b if you want to configure it by yourself, once the proyect is installed you need to serve the application on a different port that will be specified on the installation guide. (port 80 - default)



# Installation

1. For the docker users you need to enter the container with, once there all the follow up steps will be the same as the other users.


```
    docker exec -it  development-back /bin/bash
```

2. We will need to install the composer.

```
    composer install
```
    
3. Set up the .env file ( you can use the .env.example that is provided in the server, but is recommended to use your own application key generated by the command.)
```
    cp .env.example .env
```

# Testing the application.

1. Integration tests.

```
 php vendor/bin/phpunit --testsuite Integration
```

2. Functional tests.

```
 php vendor/bin/phpunit --testsuite Functional
```

3. All in one with every test.

```
 php vendor/bin/phpunit
```
